# Step 1: Assign values to the variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Step 2: Do the math
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

# Step 3: Print the results
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference}")
